description: After using the Bannerweb site on mobile, I knew I needed a better way to access my schedule on the go. I created a basic mobile application for WPI students to access their schedule from their phones. This app prompts the user for login information and can store it safely on the device, and then uses HTTP requests to get user data from the bannerweb website. Since Bannerweb does not officially expose an API, I devided not to pursue this project further.
