description: Base Chess is a mobile application that allows users to play live chess and set up realtime tournaments. I love playing chess and wanted to build my own app for it based on a beautiful chessboard theme by Deven98. I learned how to make responsive applications in Flutter and integrated a backend using Google Cloud. I used Firebase for authentication for users to login through Google accounts and Cloud Firestore as the database.
