description: My friends and I play a large scale social deception game called Real Time Mafia. In the game, there are 3 teams - the villagers, mafia, and the neutrals. Each player is able to make an action each night based on their role in the game. To make this process smooth, I wrote a bot integrated into our Slack Workspace that can moderate the game. Users were assigned roles and could submit actions each night, and these actions would refer to other players. At the end of the night, the actions would be compiled and sent to the mod team to be resolved. This project was built and deployed through Autocode which runs serverless functions.
