description: This was my groups' submission for the HACK@WPI 2020 hackathon. Inspired by the lack of social interaction throughout the pandemic, we decided to make an app to allow users to subscribe to groups related to their interests and join queues based on what activities they want to participate in. This can be for finding a quick duo partner in a video game, a small study group for an upcoming test, or a large scale boba run. Goatbook will send notifications to subscribed users when a queue becomes full, and will put all those users into an anonymous chatroom to decide whether they would like to share details and meet up, whether that be in a small group or online.
