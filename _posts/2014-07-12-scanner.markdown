description: This project was to create a 3D scanner using the parts of an old 3D printer. I designed the parts in Solidworks and 3D printed them to form the chassis. The core electronics included the arduino UNO, stepper motor drivers, an SD card reader, and a bluetooth module. These components were controlled using the desktop application that I made in Python.
